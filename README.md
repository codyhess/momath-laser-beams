# MoMath Hackathon 2018: Newton's Bouncehouse

- project category: Math Square behavior
- Elliot Kaplan, Joe Lemonik, Keith Pallo, Cody Hess

### The Math
Newton's Bouncehouse uses laser beams to represent basic
1D kinematic principles. This includes velocity, acceleration, spring
constants, and fundamentals of trigonometry. (See PDF presentation for
more details.)

### The Submission
In Newton's Bouncehouse, users may bounce lasers off of their feet.
Lasers change colors upon hitting a wall, and turning all lasers to
the same color reveals an easter egg.

We hope to have implemented the laser animations with a cadence and
movement to illustrate point to point travel across a Cartesian plane.
Anticipation/prediction of movement is vital to successful laser
bounces.

Our target audience is a group of people of varying ages, including
small children but also their parents. We hope we have built a simple,
obvious avenue towards agency that creates cooperation.
